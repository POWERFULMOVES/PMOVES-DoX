# Notes
# - xml.etree.ElementTree has limited XPath: we split on '|' and try each selector.
# - Attributes are supported via ./@attr in this declarative file, but the current
#   loader resolves attributes by checking .find(sel).text only; for attributes,
#   also include an equivalent element path if available (e.g., ./time).
# - Adjust selectors to your LMS vendor’s XML log schema as needed.
