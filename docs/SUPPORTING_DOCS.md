# Supporting Documentation & Auto-Tagging

This document outlines the strategy for creating documentation that is **auto-tagged based on source** and **cross-referenced with the API**.

## 1. Auto-Tagging Schema

All documentation files should include YAML frontmatter to support auto-tagging by the ingestion pipeline.

```yaml
---
title: Feature Name
source: [api-spec | manual | code-analysis | user-guide]
status: [active | planned | deprecated]
api_refs:
  - GET /path/to/endpoint
  - POST /path/to/endpoint
tags: [finance, data-set, security]
---
```

### Source Types
- `api-spec`: Generated from OpenAPI/Swagger definitions.
- `manual`: Written by humans (e.g., guidelines, plans).
- `code-analysis`: Generated by analyzing the codebase (e.g., Docling).

## 2. Feature Documentation (Planned)

The following features are currently **Planned / Coming Soon**.

### Financial Statement Analysis (🚧 Planned)

```yaml
---
title: Financial Statement Analysis
source: manual
status: planned
api_refs:
  - GET /analysis/financials
tags: [finance, reporting, auto-tag:financial]
---
```

**Description:**
Automated extraction and normalization of Balance Sheets, Income Statements, and Cash Flow assertions from PDF documents.

**Planned Capabilities:**
- **Merged Header Normalization:** Consolidating multi-line headers into canonical financial terms.
- **Confidence Scoring:** Providing per-row and per-cell confidence metrics.
- **Cross-Reference:** See `docs/COOKBOOKS.md` for the planned pipeline recipe.

### Data Set Management (🚧 Planned)

```yaml
---
title: Data Set Auto-Tagging
source: manual
status: planned
api_refs:
  - POST /extract/tags
  - GET /datasets/{id}
tags: [data-set, tagging, auto-tag:dataset]
---
```

**Description:**
Automatic organization of uploaded documents into "Data Sets" based on extracted content tags and source metadata.

**Planned Capabilities:**
- **Source-Based Tagging:** Automatically applying tags like `source:email`, `source:invoice` based on ingestion origin.
- **API Cross-Reference:** Linking data sets directly to the API endpoints that generated them.
- **Governance:** Review and approval workflows for auto-generated tags.

## 3. API Cross-Referencing

Documentation should explicitly link to API definitions.

**Example:**
> To trigger the financial analysis, use the [Analyze Financials API](docs/API_REFERENCE.md#get-analysisfinancials).

**Auto-Linking:**
The documentation pipeline will scan for `api_refs` in the frontmatter and automatically inject "Related API" links at the bottom of the rendered page.
